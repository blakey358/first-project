    <h2>artefacts</h2>
    <p>Artefacts are the physical manifestations of the realms. They are the objects, structures, and phenomena that exist within the realms, and they can be used to interact with the realms in various ways.</p>
    <p>Artefacts can be anything from simple tools and weapons to complex machines and structures. They can be made from a variety of materials, including metal, wood, stone, and even organic matter. Artefacts can also be imbued with magical properties, allowing them to perform tasks that would be impossible for ordinary objects.</p>
    <p>Artefacts are often created by the inhabitants of the realms, but they can also be found in the void. Some artefacts are ancient and have been lost to time, while others are newly created and still being discovered.</p>
    <p>Artefacts can be used for a variety of purposes, including construction, transportation, communication, and even combat. They can also be used to manipulate the realms themselves, allowing the user to alter the fabric of reality.</p>
    <p>Artefacts are an essential part of the realms, and they play a crucial role in the lives of the inhabitants. They are the tools that allow the inhabitants to interact with their environment, and they are often the key to unlocking the mysteries of the realms.</p>
